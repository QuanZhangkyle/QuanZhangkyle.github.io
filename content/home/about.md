I am a Ph.D. student in Economics (College of Social Sciences, UHM) and an M.S. student in Quantitative Health Sciences (John A. Burns School of Medicine, UHM). My work focuses on **health economics & outcomes research**, **causal inference & policy evaluation**, and **public health analytics (UHERO/QHS)**. I build survey‑weighted econometric pipelines (DAG/SEM/IPTW; GLM/regularization) in R/Python/SQL to study social vulnerability, inflammation (CRP), and glycemic control (HbA1c), and to support policy‑facing reporting for the Rapid Health Survey and MauiWES.
